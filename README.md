## Installation

We take a working Fabric installation for granted. Have a look at the
[Fabric website](https://fabricmc.net/) if you haven't installed it yet.

Simply drag the mod into your `mods` folder. We recommend also using
[Modmenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) (for editing rainbowify's settings
ingame). rainbowify is compatible with [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium),
so you may want to use that as well for improved performance.

## Development Setup

1. Clone this project `git clone https://github.com/officialLennox/rainbowify`
2. Open the project in IntelliJ as gradle project
3. Execute the `genSources` gradle task
4. Build the jar with the `assemble` gradle task
